## Description 

This project utilizes ReactJS to create a single-page application with conditional rendering. Interactive elements include navigation, forms, and downloadables. This is a project I intend on improving over time.

## User Story

```md
AS AN employer looking for candidates with experience building single-page applications
I WANT to view a potential employee's deployed React portfolio of work samples
SO THAT I can assess whether they're a good candidate for an open position
```
